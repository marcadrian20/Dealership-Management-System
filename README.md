# Dealership-Management-System

This is a Dealership Management System made by me with the aim of learning the ropes of .Net and databases.
## For now it is not entirely tested but the following are implemented:
<ol>
  <li>Inventory Management(barely):</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Add, remove and modify cars from the lot.</li>
      <li>Each car has a manufacturer,model,year,KMs,style and condition to it.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## Planned for the future:
1. Customer account system
2. Employee management system
3. Car ratings and reviews
4. Top picks
5. Car booking
6. Car maintenance services
