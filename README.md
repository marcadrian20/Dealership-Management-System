# Dealership-Management-System

This is a Dealership Management System made by me with the aim of learning the ropes of .Net and databases.
## For now it is not entirely tested but the following are implemented:
1.Inventory Management(barely): 
        1. 
Add, remove and modify cars from the lot.
        2.
Each car has a manufacturer,model,year,KMs,style and condition to it.
2.
## Planned for the future:
1. Customer account system
2. Employee management system
3. Car ratings and reviews
4. Top picks
5. Car booking
6. Car maintenance services
