# Dealership-Management-System

This is a Dealership Management System made by me with the aim of learning the ropes of .Net and databases.
##For now it is not entirely tested but the following are implemented:
~Inventory Management(barely): Add, remove and modify cars from the lot.Each car has a manufacturer,model,year,KMs,style and condition to it.

##Planned for the future:
~Customer account system
~Employee management system
~Car ratings and reviews
~Top picks
~Car booking
~Car maintenance services
